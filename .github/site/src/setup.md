# Setup

To use Goral you need to have a Google account and obtain a service account:
1) [Create a project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) (we suggest creating a separate project for Goral for security reasons)
2) Enable Sheets from the [products page](https://console.cloud.google.com/workspace-api/products)
3) Create a [service account](https://console.cloud.google.com/workspace-api/credentials) with `Editor` role
4) Create a private key (type JSON) for it (the private key should be downloaded by your browser)
5) Create a spreadsheet (where the scraped data will be stored) and add the service account email as an `Editor` to the spreadsheet
6) Extract spreadsheet id from the spreadsheet url

Steps 5-6 can be repeated for each [service](./services.md) (it is recommended to have separate spreadsheets for usability and separation of concerns).

*Note*: you can also install Google Sheets app for your phone to have an access to the data.

Notifications are sent to messengers with three levels:
* 🟢 (INFO)
* 🟡 (WARN)
* 🔴 (ERROR)

and are prefixed with id (the argument for `--id` flag). Messengers are configured separately for every service so that you can use e.g. Discord for General service and Telegram for Healthcheck.

*Note*: for Telegram all info-level messages are sent without notification so the phone doesn't vibrate or make any sound.
