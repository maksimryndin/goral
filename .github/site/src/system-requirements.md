# System requirements

* Memory: RSS 30M, 900M for virtual memory. An actual requirement may be different - as it depends on the amount of data, scrape and push intervals (see below for each [service](./services.md))
* Binary size is around 15 Mb
* Platforms: Linux (`x86-64` or `aarch64`). Other platforms - namely MacOS (M1 `arm`) and Windows - will probably work also.
